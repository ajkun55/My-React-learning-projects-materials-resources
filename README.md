I learned React from these projects, they are efficient to improve your skills in React.

The projects are built with Vite, mainly functional components, the props and state characters of React are fully presented.

Also contains example and usage of useState(), useEffect(), useContext(), useRef() hooks.

Start the project after have the files and change directory, then 

```
npm run dev
```
